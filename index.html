                        <br>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Taehan Lee and I’m running as an independent candidate to become an ASUC Senator for the 2017-18 academic school year! I’m a second year student majoring in Political Science originally from Seoul, Korea, but I went to high school in Ohio. When I came to Cal, I thought I would fit right in with civically engaged students who enjoyed debating issues and keeping tabs on politics just like I do. I was quickly blown away by how well-informed my fellow Golden Bears were and how much I learned about what it means to be active in public service. For the past two years, I’ve been working in the ASUC, learning and watching from other student leaders trying to make our student government a more effective body that can represent students. But student politics isn’t the only thing I’m focused on, I also love socializing with my friends in KUNA, KASA, and ISAB and playing with my soccer team Galacticos. Through all my times at Berkeley, I’m ready to put my effort in and present my vision for the ASUC and how it can develop into an inclusive space for the generality and plurality of Cal students. </p>

                    <h4 class="media-heading">SAFETY</h4>
                    <p class="bg">Even if the statistics show that crime is in the decline, as UCPD claims, there is a clear mood among students on this campus that there is a risk of personal safety when walking on and off campus in the Berkeley area, especially late at night. If this mood in the campus climate is persistent, the reality is that the Berkeley area will be less and less attractive for students, causing the overall standard of the university to go down. Although the UCPD and Cal Parking & Transportation offer programs like BearWalk and BearTransit that help mitigate this problem, the concern of students should be addressed in other ways by the ASUC to ensure to students that safety is a priority for the student government. As a result, I want to implement these ideas to improve student safety on and off campus at UC Berkeley:</p>
                    <ul class="pltfrms">
                        <li>Advocate to the Compliance and Enterprise Risk Committee (CERC) to increase funding for BearTransit and create new BearTransit routes that stop at common off-campus housing locations</li>
                        <li>Add a feature to the Berkeley Mobile application in collaboration with the Office of the Chief Technology Officer that will allow students returning home from campus late at night to find other students who are going somewhere in a similar vicinity</li>
                        <li>Work with UCPD and City Council to install solar-powered paver lights into the ground both on and off campus in order to provide cost-effective lighting and provide a safer environment</li>

                  <div class="media-body">
                    <h4 class="media-heading">CAMPUS</h4>
                    <p class="bg">In the Fall of 2015, the UC Regents announced that 10,000 more California undergraduates would be admitted to the UC campuses over the upcoming three years. Five thousand of those first year and transfer students have entered the UC system this Fall, and although it is very positive to see so many more students able to receive an UC education, the quality of this education becomes an issue with so many more students on campus. I think that the allocation of campus resources must be considered when admitting so many more students, and I believe that the ASUC must play a part in making sure that students can still receive the full UC Berkeley experience. As a result, I will: </p>
                    <ul class="pltfrms">
                        <li>Create a University-wide mentorship program in conjunction with Undergraduate Advising within each of the colleges that works to connect incoming freshmen with mentors who are declared in the intended major</li>
                        <li>Work with Berkeley Study Abroad to increase awareness about the accessibility of study abroad programs and create a Study Abroad Fund while working with the AAVP Grants Department in order to make study abroad more accessible to students of low-income background</li>
                        <li>Collaborate with the Fall Program for Freshmen program staff in order to make sure that the program benefits the students, including offering better transportation options for the San Francisco program students through working with Cal Parking & Transportation</li>

                   <p class="bg">In my time at UC Berkeley, I have learned the importance of my identity as a Korean and Asian student. Being an active member of these communities on campus has shown me that these students often have problems that are unrecognized, such as financial issues for international students. I think that it is important to continue doing work for my communities in order for the future students at this university to foster the same community that I was able to develop. As a result, I will:</p>
                    <ul class="pltfrms">
                        <li>Create a comprehensive orientation page for new and transfer students in collaboration with New Student Services in the Office of Admissions that include translated pages in multiple languages in order for English-as-a-second-language students to have more accessibility to orientation materials, along with resources and information that pertain to international students</li>
                        <li>Plan and host an Asian Leadership Conference where student leaders from the different Asian student organizations can meet and collaborate to share the successes within the communities and learn from each other to be better Asian student leaders</li>
                        <li>Work with the Office of Financial Aid to offer external aid options to international students and host Financial Aid workshops specific to international students that aim to connect those students with external aid resources and scholarships</li>

                <h3>Why Independent?</h3>
                <p>To be completely honest, I originally applied to run for ASUC Senate with a political party, aligning with what many other ASUC candidates do, and following the status quo of “running with a party”. I was unfortunately rejected by the political party, and I definitely recognize the numerous qualified candidates that run with the political parties on our campus. But after a lot of self-reflection, I realized that student leaders for our campus don’t necessarily have to come from political parties. Any individual who has the willingness and ability to represent students should have the venue to do so, and I want to show people that running as an independent candidate is not as scary as it may seem. Independent candidates will open the ability for numerous student groups from all around campus to enter the ASUC space, and these elected officials will have the ability to represent and speak on behalf of students outside of their community, and attempt to represent the generality and plurality of students on this campus. I intend to run my campaign as an example of how effective independent student leaders can be, and I intend to be the independent ASUC Senator that can be a representative of all thirty thousand undergraduate students.</p>
